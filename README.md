Analyzing wheelchair accessibility in urban environments using Python

# Urban Accessibility for People with Limited Mobility

This project explores how accessible urban infrastructure (such as buildings, public toilets, and shared spaces) is for people with limited mobility. It uses OpenStreetMap data and Python tools for analysis and visualization.

## Planned Features:
- Data collection via Overpass API
- Mapping accessible locations
- Insights into the state of urban accessibility

## Technologies:
Python, Pandas, Folium, OpenStreetMap

## ðŸš§ Project Progress

- [x] Idea formulated  
- [x] Initial Overpass API query created  
- [ ] Data processing and filtering  
- [ ] Visualization of accessible locations on the map  
- [ ] Analysis and insights  
- [ ] Presentation of results  

### ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas

- Add filtering by object type (e.g. restaurants, schools, pharmacies)
- Evaluate accessibility by district and create a ranking
- Compare accessibility across different cities
